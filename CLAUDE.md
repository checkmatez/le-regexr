# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server at localhost:4321
- `npm run build` - Build production site to ./dist/
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check code formatting

## Architecture Overview

This is an Astro-based web application for building Last Epoch stash search strings with an intuitive UI. The app generates complex search expressions using macros, regex patterns, and logical operators.

### Core Architecture

**Main Entry Point**: `src/pages/index.astro` renders the single-page application with `StashSearchBuilder.tsx` as the primary React component.

**State Management**: Central search state is managed in `StashSearchBuilder.tsx` using React hooks, with URL synchronization for sharing search configurations.

**Search Generation**: The core logic transforms UI state into Last Epoch stash search strings:

- `src/utils/search-parser.ts` - Bidirectional parsing between search strings and UI state
- `src/utils/url-state.ts` - URL state synchronization for shareable links

**Component Structure**:

- `src/components/sections/` - Feature-specific UI sections (Item Potential, Affix Tiers, etc.)
- `src/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components (inputs, checkboxes, containers)
- `src/types/stash-search.ts` - TypeScript definitions for all search state interfaces

**Data Layer**: `src/data/stash-macros.ts` contains all macro definitions, presets, and game-specific constants.

### Key Concepts

**Macro System**: Translates user-friendly inputs into Last Epoch's macro syntax (e.g., "LP3+" for "3 or more Legendary Potential")

**Expression Building**: Supports complex logical expressions using & (AND) and | (OR) operators between search terms

**Preset System**: Pre-configured search templates for common use cases stored in `SEARCH_PRESETS`

### Development Notes

- Uses Tailwind CSS v4 with Vite plugin for styling
- React components are TypeScript with strict typing
- Husky + lint-staged enforce code formatting on commits
- Automatic GitHub Pages deployment on push to master/main branch
